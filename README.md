# Learn XQuery: A list of great articles, blog posts, and books for learning XQuery

Let's show the world how to learn XQuery. Pull requests welcome. Quality over comprehensiveness - just the best, most helpful resources, please. Talk about [`#xquery`](https://twitter.com/search?q=xquery) on Twitter.

Also, check out these [resources powered by XQuery](https://github.com/joewiz/xquerypower), [repositories with XQuery on GitHub](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3AXQuery&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults), and [questions about XQuery on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/xquery).

## Gentle introductions

- [W3Schools XQuery](http://www.w3schools.com/xquery/). Limited to XQuery 1.0, but a quick overview.
- [XQuery Wikibook Beginning Examples](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XQuery#Beginning_Examples). Perhaps the best developed portion of the XQuery Wikibook site (see remarks below).

## Materials from XQuery courses

- [Digital Humanities Courses](http://newtfire.org/dh/), by Elisa E. Beshero-Bondar. Covers many topics, including XPath and XQuery.
- [XQuery and XML Applications](http://www.adamretter.org.uk/presentations.xml), by Adam Retter. Slides from the XQuery track of the 2016 [XML Summer School](http://xmlsummerschool.com/), Oxford.
- [XQuery Summer Institute](http://xqueryinstitute.org/), hosted at Vanderbilt University in 2015.
- [Web Development Using XML](http://cscie18.dce.harvard.edu/lecture_notes/2015/), David P. Heitmeyer, CSCI E-18, Fall 2015, Harvard Extension School. (See lecture notes from this course [since 2003](http://cscie18.dce.harvard.edu/lecture_notes).)
- [Querying XML: XPath and XQuery](https://www.slideshare.net/kverbert/xml-parta), by Katrien Verbert and George Fletcher, slides from Database Technology (2ID35), Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Spring 2013.

- [XPath and XQuery](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/XPath/SelfPaced/about) ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeD6vMK-znY&list=PL3D8fVsfHcA8l2CTTwCMH9D_JFlYosLFa)), by Jennifer Widom, Stanford University, 2014. Covers the XPath language for processing XML data, along with many features of the more advanced XQuery language. Part of a set of smaller self-paced "mini-courses", which can be assembled in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases.

## In-depth introductions

Some people can learn languages by reading online tutorials. Some people like to dive into a book, or have one on their shelf for reference.

- [XQuery, 2nd Edition: Search Across a Variety of XML Data](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035589.do), Priscilla Walmsley, O'Reilly 2015. The standard text for XQuery, updated for XQuery 3.1. Also introduces [functx](http://www.xqueryfunctions.com/). Doesn't cover the topic of building applications with XQuery; this is out of scope.
- [eXist: A NoSQL Document Database and Application Platform](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026525.do), Erik Siegel and Adam Retter, 2014. If Walmsley is limited to the language, Siegel and Retter coherently introduce approaches to building applications with one popular XQuery-based platform, eXist. Example code for the book is [on GitHub](https://github.com/eXist-book/book-code).
- [XQuery from the Experts](https://www.amazon.com/XQuery-Experts-Guide-Query-Language/dp/0321180607), A bit dated (2003), and probably only available second-hand, but there's a lot of material on the concepts and purpose and role of the language rather than just a tutorial or a reference manual.

## The specs

- 3.1 (W3C Recommendation, 2017): [XQuery 3.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-31/), [Data Model](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel-31/), [Functions and Operators](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/), [Serialization](http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-xquery-serialization-31/), Update Facility (no 3.1 version yet; see the 3.0 version).
